# Udacity Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree Program

This is a repository to collect all the submitted projects during the course.

## Project 1 - Deploy a Sentiment Analysis Model
**Description:** In this project, you will construct a recurrent neural network for the purpose of determining the sentiment of a movie review using the IMDB data set. You will create this model using Amazon's SageMaker service. In addition, you will deploy your model and construct a simple web app which will interact with the deployed model.

## Project 2 - Plagiarism Detection Project
**Description:** In this project, you will be tasked with building a plagiarism detector that examines a text file and performs binary classification; labeling that file as either plagiarized or not, depending on how similar that text file is to a provided source text.

## Capstone Project - Forecasting Cryptocurrency Prices
**Description:** This is the final project of the program. The main goal is to leverage what you’ve learned throughout the Nanodegree program to solve a problem of your choice by applying machine learning algorithms and techniques. The topic I have chosen for this project is forecasting cryptocurrency prices.
