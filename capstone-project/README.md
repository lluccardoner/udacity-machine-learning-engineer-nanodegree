# Forecasting cryptocurrency price

## Description
This repository adds together the work done in the final Capstone Project of the [Udacity Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-engineer-nanodegree--nd009t) program.

The topic I have chosen for this project is forecasting cryptocurrency prices with a AWS SageMaker [DeepAR](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/deepar.html) model.

## Contents
* [Proposal](https://github.com/lluccardoner/udacity-machine-learning-engineer-nanodegree/blob/main/capstone-project/proposal.pdf) of the project.
* [Report](https://github.com/lluccardoner/udacity-machine-learning-engineer-nanodegree/blob/main/capstone-project/Capstone%20Project%20Report.pdf) of the project explaining the methodology used and the final results.
* The [notebooks](https://github.com/lluccardoner/udacity-machine-learning-engineer-nanodegree/tree/main/capstone-project/notebooks) used to process the data and to train, deploy and evaluate the models.
* The raw [dataset](https://github.com/lluccardoner/udacity-machine-learning-engineer-nanodegree/tree/main/capstone-project/data/raw) used in this project downloaded from the [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/cryptocurrencypricehistory) webpage.

## Requirements
This project has been fully developed using AWS [SageMaker](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/) cloud service. The notebooks were executed on a SageMaker notebook isntance. An account to Amazon Web Services is needed. If doing this project on your own, take into consideration the Sagemaker [costs](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/pricing/) such as running instances and enpoints.
